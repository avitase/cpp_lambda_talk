# Abstract
From a syntactical point of view, the Lambda expression of C++ is nothing but syntactic sugar of a struct with an appropriate call operator overload. On the other hand, this simple syntax is shockingly flexible and allows powerful abstractions in a functional way, while providing elegant and easy to read code in a language that is notoriously famous for being unnecessary clunky and verbose.

I will give an overview about the basic syntax and best practices. I will then talk about stateful Lambdas, Lambda inheritance and their real-world applications.
